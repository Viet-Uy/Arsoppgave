# Epic Game
Epic game is a GUI-based multiple-choice game where you have 4 options to choose from in each room. Later in the game, all the choices you make will affect the ending you get and will also have consequences. 
# Language
The language used to create this game is Java, mainly because I wanted to learn more about Java and we had a certain foundation to build upon (a text-based role-playing game). The server I use acts as the connection between the server and the client PC. 
# Database
The database is hosted on MySQL and can be viewed through the phpMyAdmin page. If you get tired of playing and want to continue another time, you can also save your progress. 
# Saving
Your progress, including name, HP, weapons, and position, is saved, ensuring you can pick up right where you left off when you return to play again. As you progress in the game, you will acquire new weapons and encounter enemies.
The better the weapons you get, the easier it will be for you to defeat the enemies you encounter along the way. The server being used is Apache, and everything within the database I use is run on XAMPP.

# Important!
Please note that this game can only be run locally with a specific XAMPP and directory setup. It is not hosted on any servers, so you can only play it on your PC by following the different guides listed under the documents folder, these are also listed in norwegian.
